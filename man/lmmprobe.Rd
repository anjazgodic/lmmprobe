\arguments{
\item{Y}{A matrix containing the outcome \code{Y}.}

\item{Z}{A matrix containing the sparse fixed-effect predictors on which to apply the lmmprobe algorithm.}

\item{V}{A matrix containing non-sparse predictors for the random effects. This matrix is currently only programmed for two scenarios. Scenario 1: only a random intercept, where V is a matrix with one column containing ID's and each unit has the same number of observations. Scenario 2: a random intercept and a random slope, where V is a matrix with two columns. The first column is ID and the second column is a continuous variable (e.g. time) for which a random slope is to be estimated. Each unit has the same number of observations.}

\item{alpha}{Type I error; significance level.}

\item{ep}{Value against which to compare convergence criterion, we recommend 0.05.}

\item{B}{The number of groups to categorize estimated coefficients in to calculate correlation \eqn{\rho}. We recommend five.}

\item{adj}{A factor multiplying Silvermanâ€™s 'rule of thumb' in determining the bandwidth for density estimation, same as the 'adjust' argument of R's density function. Default is three.}

\item{maxit}{Maximum number of iterations the algorithm will run for. Default is 10000.}

\item{cpus}{The number of CPUS user would like to use for parallel computations. Default is four.}

\item{LR}{A learning rate parameter \code{r}. Using zero corresponds to the implementation described in Zgodic et al.}

\item{C}{A learning rate parameter \code{c}. Using one corresponds to the implementation described in Zgodic et al.}

\description{
Sparse high-dimensional linear mixed modeling with PaRtitiOned empirical Bayes ECM (LMM-PROBE) algorithm. Currently, the package offers functionality for two scenarios. Scenario 1: only a random intercept, each unit has the same number of observations; Scenario 2: a random intercept and a random slope, each unit has the same number of observations. We are actively expanding the package for more flexibility and scenarios.
